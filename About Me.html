                        <h3>Hi There...</h3>
                        <p>I'm Adegboyega Kujore studiyng Information Technology Infrastructure and
                            services at sheridan
                            college. I am currently in my second year. One of my favorite courses so far is web
                            technology
                            and operating technology. Throughout my stay at sheridan college, I've been exposed to a
                            whole
                            lot in the I.T field both theoretically and practically. The skills I have acquired as a
                            result
                            are troubleshooting, programming, critical thinking, enterpreneurship and communication
                            skills.
                            I also have my background in Electrical/Electronics Engineering where I was also exposed to
                            a
                            lot of Electrical concepts theoretically and on the field as well. I've been oppurtuned to
                            have
                            practical experience in the Transmission company and also in Oil and Gas. Moving forward, I
                            will, like to still improve my knowledge and experience in the Information Technology field
                            as
                            it brings a whole of oppurtunities.
